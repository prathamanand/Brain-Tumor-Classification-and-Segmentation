Developed a deep learning pipeline using ResNet50 for classifying brain tumors in MRI images. Implemented a subsequent ResUnet model for segmenting the tumor region upon detection.
 Built a deep learning system to analyze MRI scans. Leverages ResNet50 to classify tumors and ResUnet for precise tumor segmentation, aiding diagnosis.
Implemented a two-stage deep learning approach for brain tumor analysis in MRI. ResNet50 classifies tumor presence, while ResUnet segments the tumor for detailed evaluation.
